# sql-challenge

In this Employee Challenge, I used SQL to create tables of the following information required in a company's structure: Departments, Department Employees, Department Managers, Employees, Salaries, and Titles.

With these tables, I used select statements and joined some of the mentioned tables to create an analysis of employees and team structures within the company.
