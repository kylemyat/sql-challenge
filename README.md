# sql-challenge

In this Employee Challenge, I used SQL to create tables the following information required in a company: Departments, Department Employees, Department Managers, Employees, Salaries, and Titles.

With these tables, I used select statements and joined some of the mentioned tables to create an analysis of employees.
